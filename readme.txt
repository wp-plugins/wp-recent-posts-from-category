Displays recent posts from selected category by generating a shortcode that can be used in widgets, posts and pages.

== Description ==

The "WP Recent Posts From Category" is a simple plugin that allows you to insert a list of recent posts from the desired category in a widget, post or page.

Using the shortcode generator you can easily customize the list of posts, you just have to paste the generated shortcode wherever you want the list to show.
Customizables options include:

* the desired category
* the number of posts to display
* include/exclude posts from children categories
* show excerpt
* show author and date in the output.

Styling the output is easy if you are confident with CSS, as you can apply a custom class to the list container, or use the default "rpfc-container" class instead.
